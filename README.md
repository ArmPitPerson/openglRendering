# OpenGL Rendering

This repository contains my implementations of a graphics rendering pipeline from scratch in my journey to learn modern OpenGL. Here are some important things to know about this project:

* GLFW is used for context creation
* The target OpenGL version for this project is OpenGL *4.5*
* My learning material is the *OpenGL Superbible 7th edition*
* It is a personal project where I will constantly improve my OpenGL skills and attempt to improve the code.
* It does not *currently* represent final quality code
