# OpenGL Rendering

This repository contains my implementations of a graphics rendering pipeline from scratch in my journey to learn modern OpenGL. Here are some important things to know about this project:

* GLFW is used for context creation
* The target OpenGL version for this project is OpenGL *4.5*
* My learning material is the *OpenGL Superbible 7th edition*
* It is a personal project where I will constantly improve my OpenGL skills and attempt to improve the code.
* It does not *currently* represent final quality code

### 1.0 Contributing
If any OpenGL gurus stumble upon this project and would like to provide feedback or guidance, please create an issue with your feedback and what I could to to fix it. I will attempt to close it by following your advice.

### 1.1 What I Have Learned
 * Vertex Attributes
 * Vertex Arrays
 * Index Buffers
 * Shaders
 * Uniforms
 * Uniform Blocks
 * Atomic Counters
 * Array Textures
 * Texture Views
 * Textures
 * Samplers
 * Images

### 1.2 Example Renders
This section contains a few example screenshots of what I've achieved with this project so far. There is no particular order, and is mostly provided to see progress. The images are dated.
